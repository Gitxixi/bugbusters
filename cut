hoho:hehe:I have considered 			that model. There is a retail store named lendmeurear in Singapore which sells these ear-buds and I spotted some feedback on their Facebook 	 page about defective GR07. Some were sent to Chinese (under warranty) for several weeks and still no response from the Chinese service 	 center.
